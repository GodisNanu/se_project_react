# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

## Features

- The user can switch between Fahrenheit and Celcius using a toggle switch
- The user can acess a profile page by clicking the profile picture
- The user can add or delete clothing items

## Tech Stack
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACTJS, JSX, REST API, GITHUB, FIGMA, JSON

## Roadmap

My intention is to add to this design so that it is more responsive and interactive.  I plan to update the design so that the user can change the profile information and current location.

CURRENTLY the deployed application WILL NOT DISPLAY because the server is coded to run locally.  To view the application in its current state, you will need to clone the repo from GitHub, install JSON by running ' npm install -g json-server@^0 ' in the terminal, then run the command 'json-server --watch db.json --id _id --port 3001' to start the JSON server.  Afterwards, you can open a 2nd terminal to run the react application.
