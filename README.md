# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

## Features

- The user can switch between Fahrenheit and Celcius using a toggle switch
- The user can acess a profile page by clicking the profile picture
- The user can add or delete clothing items
- The user can change profile information
- The user can signin and singout securely

## Tech Stack
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACTJS, JSX, REST API, GITHUB, FIGMA, JSON

## Roadmap
  I plan to update the design so that the user can change the current location.
