# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

## Features

- The user can switch between Fahrenheit and Celcius using a toggle switch
- The user can acess a profile page by clicking the profile picture
- The user can add or delete clothing items

## Tech Stack
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACTJS, JSX, REST API, GITHUP, FIGMA, JSON

## Roadmap

My intention is to add to this design so that it is more responsive and interactive.  I plan to update the design so that the user can change the profile information and current location.
